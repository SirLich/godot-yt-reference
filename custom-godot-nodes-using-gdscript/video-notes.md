# Video Notes: Random Timer using GDScript

You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhoVDeLMcks)

The major pushback I got on this video is that 'Custom Nodes' in Godot Engine really don't apply to class-name GDScript classes. While there are some similarities (such as the ability to place them into the scene-tree using the node selector), they aren't considered truly "custom" nodes. 

Custom Nodes in Godot can only properly created using an editor plugin or GDExtension. Read about that stuff [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/making_plugins.html#a-custom-node). Interestingly enough, the docs themselves suggest that a Script Class (as I show in this video), is the preferred flow for GDScript. 

Everything I showed in the video is useful. Happy coding!
